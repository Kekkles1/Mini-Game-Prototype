# Mini-Game-Prototype
Mini-Game Prototype where you time your button presses. Created as my assignment as a research assistant. You press spacebar when the arrow falls within the range of the green bar. After 3 successful attempts, the game automatically ends. The greenbar re-adjusts its position and size to fit within the red bar after each successful attempt.
